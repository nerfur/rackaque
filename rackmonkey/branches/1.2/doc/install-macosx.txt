1. Introduction  
===============
This document explains how to perform a fresh install of RackMonkey with 
SQLite on Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) or 10.6 (Snow Leopard). Versions of OS X 
prior to 10.5 have a different Apache set up, so can't use this procedure. If 
you wish to install RackMonkey on an older version of OS X, or use a If you 
database other than SQLite, please consult the generic installation 
instructions: doc/install.txt. For upgrades you should follow doc/upgrade.txt.

You need a web browser with JavaScript enabled to access the RackMonkey
interface. Any reasonably standards-compliant browser should work, but the 
following browsers are officially supported:

 * Firefox 2, 3
 * Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8
 * Safari 2, 3, 4
 
Please note that the $ shown at the start of commands represent the shell
prompt, you should not type it.
