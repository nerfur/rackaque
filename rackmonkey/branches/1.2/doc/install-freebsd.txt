1. Introduction  
===============
This document provides a short guide to installing RackMonkey on FreeBSD. 
Thanks go to Eric F. Crist for creating and maintaining the FreeBSD port.

For general advice on installing and managing FreeBSD ports see:

	http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/ports-using.html
	
You need a web browser with JavaScript enabled to access the RackMonkey
interface. Any reasonably standards-compliant browser should work, but the 
following browsers are officially supported:

 * Firefox 2, 3
 * Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8
 * Safari 2, 3, 4
 
Please note that the # shown at the start of commands represent the shell
prompt, you should not type it.


2. Apache
=========
You need a working Apache instance in order to install RackMonkey. If you 
haven't already got one you can install Apache 2.2 as follows (as root):

	# cd /usr/ports/www/apache22
	# make install clean

Start Apache:
	# apachectl start
	
Start Apache at boot:
	# echo 'apache22_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf

		
3. Install  
==========
To install RackMonkey and its dependencies (as root):

	# cd /usr/ports/net-mgmt/rackmonkey
	# make install clean

You will be asked which database engine you wish to use and whether you want
optional plugins enabled. The default values should be fine for most users.

FreeBSD will then install the dependencies for RackMonkey. This may take some 
time and some of the dependencies (e.g. SQLite) may prompt you for options.

Once the install is complete you need to configure Apache. You will need to
adjust the following commands if you're not using Apache 2.2.

Create a symlink into web space:
	# ln -s /usr/local/www/rackmonkey /usr/local/www/apache2/data
	
NB. This symlinks the whole of RackMonkey, including any SQLite database, into 
web space. Use with caution.

Create /usr/local/etc/apache22/Includes/httpd-rackmonkey.conf with the 
following content:

	<Location /rackmonkey>
   		Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks Includes
   		AddHandler cgi-script .pl
   		AddType text/html .shtml
   		AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
   		DirectoryIndex rackmonkey.pl index.shtml index.html
   		SetEnv RACKMONKEY_CONF /usr/local/www/rackmonkey/rackmonkey.conf
	</Location>

Get Apache to reload its configuration:
	# apachectl graceful


3. Running RackMonkey
=====================
Point your web browser at one of the following:

    http://localhost/rackmonkey/rackmonkey.pl (for local connections)
    http://<hostname>/rackmonkey/rackmonkey.pl (for remote connections)

You should be greeted by the RackMonkey interface. If all is well, read the
user guide under the 'Help' tab within the RackMonkey interface.

If you get an error, check out doc/troubleshooting.txt and README for advice.


4. FreeBSD Port Support
=======================
This port is not maintained or supported by the RackMonkey developers. If you 
have any questions or issues with the port you should contact the maintainer. 
For more information on the RackMonkey port see:
